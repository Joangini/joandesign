## Overview

This project focused on redesigning the user dashboard and settings section for a SaaS platform to improve user control, accessibility, and overall experience.

## Challenge

Users were struggling to find and modify important account settings, resulting in increased support tickets and reduced user satisfaction. The dashboard needed to be reorganized to provide clearer access to frequently used features.

## Design Process

### User Research
- Analyzed support ticket themes to identify common user struggles
- Conducted usability tests on the existing dashboard
- Created user journey maps to understand the settings modification workflow

### Information Architecture
- Reorganized settings into logical categories based on user mental models
- Prioritized frequently accessed settings for easier discovery
- Created a simplified navigation system for the settings area

### Design Development
- Created wireframes for both dashboard overview and detailed settings pages
- Developed a consistent component system for settings controls
- Designed clear feedback mechanisms for settings changes

## Key Features

- **Customizable Dashboard**: Users can now personalize their dashboard view
- **Simplified Settings Navigation**: Clear categorization of all available settings
- **Search Functionality**: Added search capability across all settings
- **Quick Settings**: One-click access to frequently modified options
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional across all device sizes

## Results

After implementation, the redesigned dashboard and settings section resulted in:
- 60% reduction in settings-related support tickets
- 35% increase in users successfully completing settings changes
- Positive feedback from user satisfaction surveys highlighting improved usability

## Learnings

This project reinforced the importance of information architecture in complex interfaces. The most significant improvements came not from visual design changes but from thoughtful reorganization of settings based on user expectations and behavior patterns.
