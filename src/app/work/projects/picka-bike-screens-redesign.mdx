## Overview

PICKA BIKE is a bike-sharing service that needed a refreshed user interface to improve engagement and usability. The redesign focused on streamlining the bike selection, booking, and return processes.

## Challenge

The original app had a dated interface with confusing navigation patterns and inconsistent visual elements, resulting in user frustration and abandoned bookings.

## Design Process

### Analysis
- Conducted a thorough review of the existing app interface
- Analyzed user feedback and pain points
- Benchmarked against competitor bike-sharing applications

### Redesign Strategy
- Simplified the booking flow from 5 steps to 3 steps
- Created a more intuitive map interface for locating available bikes
- Designed a clearer visual hierarchy for important information

### Visual Design
- Implemented a refreshed color palette that improved readability outdoors
- Created custom iconography for bike types and features
- Designed consistent UI components using a modular approach

## Key Improvements

- **Streamlined Booking Process**: Reduced the time to book a bike by 40%
- **Enhanced Map Experience**: Improved location accuracy and bike availability indicators
- **Simplified Return Process**: Created an intuitive QR-code based return verification
- **Account Management**: Redesigned user profiles for easier access to ride history and payment information

## Results

The redesigned app saw a 35% increase in completed bookings and a 28% increase in return user engagement within the first month after launch.

## Learnings

This project highlighted the importance of understanding the context in which users interact with an app. Design considerations for outdoor use (high sunlight, possible rain) significantly influenced the visual design decisions.
