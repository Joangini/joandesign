## Overview

NCS provides tools for early-stage startups to manage growth, fundraising, and operations. Their dashboard interface needed a redesign to better serve their evolving user base.

## Challenge

The original dashboard was designed when the platform had fewer features, leading to navigation issues, inconsistent UI patterns, and difficulties finding key information as the product grew.

## Design Process

### User Research
- Conducted interviews with startup founders and team members
- Analyzed usage data to identify most-used and underutilized features
- Created user journey maps to understand workflow patterns

### Dashboard Architecture
- Reorganized information hierarchy based on user needs
- Created a modular dashboard system to accommodate future growth
- Designed a customizable layout to serve different user roles

### Visual Design
- Refreshed the UI with a cleaner, more modern aesthetic
- Created a consistent component library for dashboard elements
- Improved data visualization for key metrics and analytics

## Key Features

- **Customizable Dashboard**: Users can arrange modules based on their priorities
- **Improved Navigation**: Simplified global navigation with contextual sub-navigation
- **Quick Actions**: Added frequently used actions for faster workflow
- **Analytics Overview**: Enhanced data visualization for key business metrics
- **Notification Center**: Centralized system for updates and alerts

## Results

The redesigned dashboard resulted in:
- 45% improvement in task completion rates
- 30% reduction in time spent looking for information
- Positive user feedback on both aesthetic and functionality improvements

## Learnings

This project emphasized the importance of designing scalable interfaces that can grow with the product. Building a robust component system was crucial for maintaining consistency while allowing for future expansion of features.
