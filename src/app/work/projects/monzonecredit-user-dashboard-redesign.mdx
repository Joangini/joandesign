## Overview

Monzonecredit's user dashboard required a redesign to improve user engagement, data clarity, and overall usability for their financial services platform.

## Challenge

The original dashboard was cluttered with information, had poor visual hierarchy, and lacked intuitive navigation, resulting in high user frustration and support calls.

## Design Process

### User Research
- Analyzed user behavior data to identify high-traffic dashboard areas
- Conducted interviews with current users to identify pain points
- Created user personas based on different financial management styles

### Information Architecture
- Reorganized dashboard content based on user needs and task frequency
- Simplified navigation with clear labeling and logical grouping
- Designed an improved notification system for financial alerts

### Visual Design
- Created a clean, modern interface with improved readability
- Developed custom data visualization components for financial metrics
- Implemented an accessible color system for financial status indicators

## Key Improvements

- **Financial Overview**: Redesigned the summary section to highlight the most critical information
- **Transaction History**: Improved filtering and search capabilities for transaction records
- **Goal Tracking**: Added visual indicators for savings and financial goal progress
- **Account Management**: Simplified settings and security features access

## Results

After the redesign implementation, Monzonecredit saw a 45% reduction in support tickets related to dashboard navigation issues and a 30% increase in user session time, indicating improved engagement with their financial information.

## Learnings

This project reinforced the importance of data visualization in financial applications. Users' understanding and engagement with their financial information dramatically improved when presented with clear, well-designed visual representations rather than raw numbers.
